\section{Research Experience}
\cventry{Spring.2014}{Pedestrian Segmentation after Detection}{Diploma Project}{advised by Ai Haizhou}{}
{
Features
\begin{itemize}
\item Apply superpixel segmentation as an approach to preprocess the image as pre-segmentation.
\item Propose a probabilistic model to compute the segmentation confidence map.
\item Apply sparse coding method to the process of result refinement.
\end{itemize}
Experiments demonstrate that our method is much more efficient than the usual  Graph-Cut based method.
}
\cventry{Summer.2013}{Context based Binary Image Retrieval  based on Visual Vocabulary}{Hong Kong Polytechnic University}{}{}
{
Features
\begin{itemize}
\item apply the algorithm to patent image retrieval.
\item the recall rate is 5\% higher than the best method(AHDH)
\end{itemize}
This work is going to submit to ICPR 2014.
}
\cventry{Mar. 2013}{Handwriting Digits Recognition based on Neural Network and Restricted Boltzmann Machine}{Artificial Neural Network}{advised by Prof. Zhu Xiaoyan}{}
{
Features
\begin{itemize}
\item back-probagation neural network
\item restricted Boltzmann machine to pre-train the digits data
\item directional line element as selected feature
\item the precision rate is over 97\% 
\end{itemize}
}
\cventry{Oct. 2012}{Viberation Frequency Computation of Elastic Object by Computer Vision Methods}{Computer Vision}{}{}
{
Practical work to support a research on electricity engineering. At first the task is to analyze a video of a vibrating composite insulator at a high rate with small amplitude, which can be hardly detected by human eyes. I found a method to extract the shape transformation of the insulator and compute the length and area of the shape, then the frequency can be easily compute by FFT(fast Fourier transform). Incidentally, all these work is finished in 2 hours.
}
\cventry{Jun. 2012}{Digital Tone Tuner Design and Fabrication}{Digital Logic Circuits}
{cooperated with Ai Qingyao}{}
{
This is the final project for my Digital Logic Circuits course. We achieve
\begin{itemize}
\item listen and recognize a tune, then play it again.
\item each part of the gadget was selected and purchased on our own
\item compact printable circuit board design
\item the core algorithm is implemented on a programmable logic device using VHDL.
\item show the level of tune by an LED board, get the tune by a MIC and play it by a speaker
\end{itemize}
